My name is Jordan Gresham, I go by JJ and I really enjoy learning about technology strategies. I am excited to be in this class and have the opportunity to understand more strategy and collaboration tactics. I have 2 little boys Diesel (7) and Harrison (1.5) and live in Lehi, UT. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, playing sports and spending time with my family.
